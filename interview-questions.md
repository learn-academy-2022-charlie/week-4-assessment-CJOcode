# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  Props are short for properties, these pertain to components and there values. So if you have a car, for instance, all cars have similar properties such as wheels, engines, and windows. You can take those properties from the parent components and pass them to your child components using the keyword this.props.'name of key'.This makes data easily accessible through out your code without having to repetitively write out the general properties that every car has.

  Researched answer:
  Props in react can be thought of as an argument in a function or an attribute in HTML. A parent component holds state which is data that is assign to a specific class. We use this.props. to pass and reuse that data to nested components. In the nest components is where we use those props to create the interactive part of our websites.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  DOM is something that is used with React that takes in all of our code and actually displays it on our screen. It is what makes our application interactive with the user.

  Researched answer:
  DOM, the Document Object Model, is a program interface that allows for all of our code to display on our web pages and be interactive with the user. It takes all of our code combined in React and actually puts it to use on our web page. You can easily access the DOM within Javascript by creating a <script> tag, from there you can manipulate the document.


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:
  Object oriented programming allows for easy access of data that carries traits and is reusable. So instead of having to rewrite code over and over again it allows use to be organized and efficient. You can create a class that describes an object within its constructor. Then reuse that information passing it to other components within our code.
  I'm not to familiar with functional programing but I would guess that it is a way of coding that requires you to make specific functions for every piece of code you write that are not reusable. 


  Researched answer:
  Functional programming is non-manipulative un like Object Oriented Programming. Functions are "as is" in Functional programming and will have the same result with what every arguments are placed inside them. This provides for a more efficient, bug free, code that can actually reused easily it but it is harder to think through this type of code because it does not relate much to real life scenarios, its more of a computer language than a human language. While OOP is more human relative but is actually know to be less reusable. OOP is mostly use for more architectural projects that need to be broken up into separate building blocks that work together like building a house you need separate templates for electrical, foundations, design, and plumbing. Then OOP puts them together to create the house.




4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  Integers are whole numbers with no remainders. While a float is an integer that has a decimal or fractional parts.

  Researched answer:
  Both numerical data, Floats are used when there is more precision needed for a problem. Floats can be changed into Integers or whole numbers by adding Math.floor to them which round the decimal to the nearest whole number.  


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:
  Implicit return means that, for example, within a function or method you do not have to actually write return, but it will automatically return the last line in the function.

  Researched answer:
  The difference between implicit returns and explicit returns are that explicit are more specific about what they want to be returned. While on the other hand implicit returns are implying that the last line of code is what they want to be printed with out having to use syntax's to specify what you want to be ran.




## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: 
variables that are inside of a class that start with @ allowing for you to assign it a value. Sort of like a state in Javascript.

2. PostgreSQL: is a primary data base for web applications allowing them to run dynamically

3. Ruby on Rails:
Is another program that allows use to combine different languages of code and send them to the DOM where we can interact with our code on the user interfaces.

4. ORM:
Object-relational mapping, creates a layer between languages and the database.

5. Active Record:
a layer in ruby on rails that represents models and their data.
